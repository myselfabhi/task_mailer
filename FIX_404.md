# Fix 404 Error on Vercel

## What I've Fixed

1. ✅ Created `vercel.json` with explicit Next.js configuration
2. ✅ Added `not-found.tsx` for proper 404 handling
3. ✅ Fixed `layout.tsx` (removed invalid `<head>` tag - Next.js handles this automatically)
4. ✅ Verified all app structure is correct

## Next Steps

### 1. Commit and Push All Changes

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Fix: Configure Vercel for Next.js and fix 404 error"
git push
```

### 2. In Vercel Dashboard

**Option A: Redeploy**
1. Go to your Vercel project
2. Click "Deployments" tab
3. Click the three dots (⋯) on the latest deployment
4. Click "Redeploy"
5. Select the latest commit
6. Click "Redeploy"

**Option B: Delete and Recreate (Recommended if redeploy doesn't work)**
1. Delete the current Vercel project
2. Create a new project
3. Import your GitHub repository
4. Vercel should auto-detect Next.js
5. Click "Deploy"

### 3. Verify Settings

After deployment, check:
- **Framework Preset**: Should be "Next.js"
- **Build Command**: `npm run build` (or empty for auto-detect)
- **Output Directory**: Empty (Next.js handles this)

## What Should Happen

After redeploying:
- ✅ Build should complete successfully
- ✅ App should be accessible at your Vercel URL
- ✅ No more 404 errors
- ✅ Home page should load correctly

## If Still Getting 404

1. Check Vercel build logs for errors
2. Verify `package.json` has `"build": "next build"`
3. Make sure `app/page.tsx` exists
4. Check that all files are pushed to GitHub
